This is a personal project i started to learn about smart contracts, solidity, web3, javascript and react. I have been working on this for a few months and trying to learn everything I can. Lots of credit to Jaycool on youtube whos videos were important to my understanding of these concepts. 

I will be updating this readme with more information on how to run the program.
